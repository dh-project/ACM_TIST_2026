    label: Historical events – analysis and rating
    kind: object
    description: >
      Analysis and evaluation of the historical plausibility of the narrated events
      with respect to the material described in <original_event>.
    fields:
      - name: analysis
        label: Historical events analysis
        kind: text
        description: >
          Short analysis (possibly using bullet points) of the historical plausibility
          of the events, relative to the original event and the historical context
          in <original_event>.
          You may consider, for example:
          - consistency of events with period, place and historical actors;
          - presence or absence of clear anachronisms;
          - plausibility of causes and consequences;
          - correct use of dates, key events and historical figures.
          Analytical guidelines are specified in section
          #Historical_analysis_guidelines of the prompt.
      - name: score
        label: Historical events score
        kind: enum
        choices: [1, 2, 3]
        description: >
          Integer value [1–3] measuring the plausibility of the main events
          described in the story with respect to the material in <original_event>.
          In general: 1 = low/poor plausibility, 2 = plausible with some inaccuracies,
          3 = high plausibility and overall coherence.
          Detailed criteria for choosing 1/2/3 are given in section
          #Historical_level_scale of the prompt.

  - name: historical_characters
    label: Historical characters – analysis and rating
    kind: object
    description: >
      Analysis and evaluation of the historical plausibility of the characters
      (real or inspired by historical figures) and their behaviour.
    fields:
      - name: analysis
        label: Historical characters analysis
        kind: text
        description: >
          Short analysis (possibly with bullet points) of the historical plausibility
          of the characters, relative to the context and to <original_event>.
          You may consider, for example:
          - whether mentality, values and prejudices fit the historical period;
          - plausibility of actions given social role and status;
          - realism of relationships between characters;
          - presence of psychological or behavioural anachronisms.
          Operational guidance is provided in section
          #Historical_analysis_guidelines of the prompt.
      - name: score
        label: Historical characters score
        kind: enum
        choices: [1, 2, 3]
        description: >
          Integer value [1–3] measuring the historical plausibility of the
          characters and their behaviour with respect to <original_event>.
          In general:
          - 1 = largely implausible or anachronistic behaviour,
          - 2 = generally plausible but with some forcing,
          - 3 = coherent and well aligned with the historical and social context.
          Operational criteria for 1/2/3 are specified in #Historical_level_scale.

  - name: historical_places_settings
    label: Places and settings – analysis and rating
    kind: object
    description: >
      Analysis and evaluation of the historical plausibility of places, settings
      and material details described in the story, with respect to the context
      in <original_event>.
    fields:
      - name: analysis
        label: Places and settings analysis
        kind: text
        description: >
          Short analysis (possibly using bullet points) of the historical plausibility
          of places, settings and material details.
          You may consider, for instance:
          - consistency with geography, urban layout and political context;
          - plausibility of buildings, objects, clothing and technologies;
          - accuracy of everyday-life details;
          - presence of relevant material or environmental anachronisms.
          Guidelines are specified in #Historical_analysis_guidelines.
      - name: score
        label: Places and settings score
        kind: enum
        choices: [1, 2, 3]
        description: >
          Integer value [1–3] measuring the historical plausibility of places,
          settings and material details.
          In general:
          - 1 = many implausible or overly generic elements,
          - 2 = overall plausible picture with some inaccuracies,
          - 3 = setting coherent and well compatible with period and place.
          Detailed criteria are given in #Historical_level_scale.

  - name: adherence_original_event
    label: Adherence to the original event – analysis and rating
    kind: object
    description: >
      Analysis and evaluation of how faithful the story remains to the historical
      event documented in <original_event>, while still being a fictional narrative.
    fields:
      - name: analysis
        label: Adherence analysis
        kind: text
        description: >
          Short analysis (possibly using bullet points) of the relationship between
          the story and the original event described in the reference material.
          You may consider, for example:
          - comparison between the key elements of <original_event> and those of the story;
          - relevant deviations or narrative licences and their impact;
          - the role of fictional components in shaping historical understanding;
          - whether the changes introduced distort or preserve the core meaning
            of the event.
          Detailed guidelines are defined in #Historical_analysis_guidelines.
      - name: score
        label: Adherence score
        kind: enum
        choices: [1, 2, 3]
        description: >
          Integer value [1–3] measuring the degree of faithfulness of the story
          to the historical event documented in <original_event>.
          In general:
          - 1 = low adherence (numerous strong deviations or reinterpretations
            that significantly alter the overall meaning),
          - 2 = moderate adherence (fictional licences are present but compatible
            with the general picture),
          - 3 = high adherence (the story mostly stays within the bounds of what
            is described, with minor or clearly recognizable fictional changes).
          Criteria for distinguishing 1/2/3 are specified in #Historical_level_scale.
