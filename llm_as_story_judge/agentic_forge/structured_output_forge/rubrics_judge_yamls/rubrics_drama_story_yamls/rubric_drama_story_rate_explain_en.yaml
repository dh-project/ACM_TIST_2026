fields:
  - name: storytelling_potential
    label: Storytelling potential
    kind: object
    description: >
      Analysis and rating of the narrative potential of the core event on which
      the story is built, according to the criteria in section
      #Global_level_scale of the prompt.
    fields:
      - name: score
        label: Storytelling potential score
        kind: enum
        choices: [1, 2, 3]
        description: >
          Integer value [1–3] measuring how much the core narrative event
          can generate an interesting and developable story.
          In general: 1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = good/high potential.
          Detailed criteria for 1/2/3 are defined in #Global_level_scale.
      - name: analysis
        label: Storytelling potential analysis
        kind: text
        description: >
          Short explanation (possibly using bullet points) of the reasons for
          the assigned score.
          You may consider, for example:
          - relevance and strength of the underlying event;
          - potential to develop conflict and stakes;
          - impact on characters and their possible transformations;
          - clarity and strength of the narrative trigger in the overall structure.
          The analysis should be consistent with the scale in #Global_level_scale.

  - name: dramatic_situation
    label: Dramatic situation
    kind: object
    description: >
      Analysis and rating of the strength and adequacy of the initial dramatic
      situation (conflict, stakes, relationships between characters),
      according to #Global_level_scale.
    fields:
      - name: score
        label: Dramatic situation score
        kind: enum
        choices: [1, 2, 3]
        description: >
          Integer value [1–3] evaluating the strength and adequacy of the
          starting dramatic situation.
          In general: 1 = weak/poorly adequate, 2 = adequate, 3 = very strong/adequate.
          Exact criteria are described in #Global_level_scale.
      - name: analysis
        label: Dramatic situation analysis
        kind: text
        description: >
          Short explanation (possibly with bullet points) of the reasons for
          the assigned score.
          You may consider:
          - clarity of the main conflict;
          - definition of stakes and consequences;
          - roles and positions of characters within the conflict;
          - potential for the situation to evolve across scenes.
          The analysis must remain consistent with #Global_level_scale.

  - name: dynamic_elements_realization
    label: Realization of dynamic elements
    kind: object
    description: >
      Analysis and rating of how the text realizes conflict development,
      event progression and character transformations, following the criteria
      in #Global_level_scale.
    fields:
      - name: score
        label: Dynamic elements realization score
        kind: enum
        choices: [1, 2, 3]
        description: >
          Integer value [1–3] evaluating the realization of dynamic elements
          (conflict development, progression, character change).
          In general: 1 = weak realization, 2 = acceptable/sufficient,
          3 = solid/strong realization.
          Operational details for 1–3 are given in #Global_level_scale.
      - name: analysis
        label: Dynamic elements analysis
        kind: text
        description: >
          Short explanation (possibly using bullet points) of the reasons for
          the assigned score.
          You may consider:
          - clarity of conflict escalation;
          - presence of recognizable turning points;
          - coherence of character motivations;
          - quality of emotional or status transformations of the characters.
          The analysis must justify the chosen level (1/2/3) in relation to
          #Global_level_scale.

  - name: inciting
    label: Inciting incident
    kind: object
    description: >
      Analysis and evaluation of the initial inciting incident (the trigger of
      the main conflict), as defined in section #Turning_points of the prompt.
      Logical rules linking present, ordered and scene are specified in
      #Output_logic_rules.
    fields:
      - name: present
        label: Presence
        kind: bool
        description: >
          True if a specific inciting incident can be identified; False if there
          is no clear point where the story is triggered.
          Logic rule: if present = False, then ordered must be False and
          scene must be "n/a".
          See #Turning_points and #Output_logic_rules for examples.
      - name: ordered
        label: Narrative order
        kind: bool
        description: >
          True if the inciting incident occurs before the climax and the
          resolution in a coherent narrative sequence; False otherwise
          (absent, confused or incoherently placed event).
          Logic rule: if present = False, ordered must be False.
          The conditions for correct ordering are described in #Turning_points.
      - name: scene
        label: Inciting scene
        kind: enum
        choices: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "n/a"]
        description: >
          String indicating the scene number ("1"–"8") where the inciting incident
          begins.
          Use "n/a" if no inciting incident can be identified (i.e., when present = False).
          Logic rule: if scene = "n/a", present is generally expected to be False.
          See #Turning_points for examples and clarifications.
      - name: analysis
        label: Inciting incident analysis
        kind: text
        description: >
          Short analysis (possibly using bullet points) of the choices for
          present, ordered and scene.
          You may address:
          - where and how the conflict trigger appears;
          - whether its temporal placement is coherent with climax and resolution;
          - why the chosen scene is (or is not) the most appropriate;
          - any ambiguity or lack of a genuine inciting incident.
          The analysis should be consistent with #Turning_points.

  - name: climax
    label: Climax
    kind: object
    description: >
      Analysis and evaluation of the narrative climax, the moment of highest
      tension of the main conflict. Definitions and criteria are given in
      #Turning_points.
    fields:
      - name: present
        label: Presence
        kind: bool
        description: >
          True if a clear peak moment of the conflict can be identified;
          False if there is no real climax.
          Logic rule: if present = False, then ordered must be False and
          scene must be "n/a".
      - name: ordered
        label: Narrative order
        kind: bool
        description: >
          True if the climax occurs after the inciting incident and before
          the resolution; False if it is absent or incoherently placed relative
          to the other turning points.
          Logic rule: if present = False, ordered must be False.
      - name: scene
        label: Climax scene
        kind: enum
        choices: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "n/a"]
        description: >
          String indicating the scene number ("1"–"8") where the climax begins.
          Use "n/a" if no real climax can be identified (present = False).
          Logic rule: scene = "n/a" generally implies present = False.
          See #Turning_points for the definition of climax.
      - name: analysis
        label: Climax analysis
        kind: text
        description: >
          Short analysis (possibly using bullet points) of the choices for
          present, ordered and scene.
          You may discuss:
          - why a given scene is the true peak of tension;
          - whether multiple potential climaxes exist and which one was chosen;
          - whether the placement of the climax is coherent with inciting
            incident and resolution;
          - possible absence or weakness of a real climax.
          The analysis should follow the rules in #Turning_points.

  - name: resolution
    label: Resolution
    kind: object
    description: >
      Analysis and evaluation of the final resolution of the main conflict.
      Definitions and criteria are given in #Turning_points.
    fields:
      - name: present
        label: Presence
        kind: bool
        description: >
          True if the story reaches a recognizable final state in relation to
          the main conflict; False if there is no real conclusion.
          Logic rule: if present = False, then ordered must be False and
          scene must be "n/a".
      - name: ordered
        label: Narrative order
        kind: bool
        description: >
          True if the resolution occurs after the climax and closes the main
          narrative arc; False if it is absent or incoherently placed.
          Logic rule: if present = False, ordered must be False.
      - name: scene
        label: Resolution scene
        kind: enum
        choices: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "n/a"]
        description: >
          String indicating the scene number ("1"–"8") where the resolution
          begins.
          Use "n/a" if there is no real resolution (present = False).
          Logical consistency rules linking present, ordered and scene are
          summarized in #Output_logic_rules.
      - name: analysis
        label: Resolution analysis
        kind: text
        description: >
          Short analysis (possibly using bullet points) of the choices for
          present, ordered and scene regarding the resolution.
          You may discuss:
          - whether and how the main conflict is actually closed;
          - whether the scene selected as resolution is coherent with the climax;
          - the impact of open or interrupted endings on the judgment;
          - reasons why no real resolution exists (if present = False).
          Refer to #Turning_points and #Output_logic_rules for the logic
          of the turning points.
