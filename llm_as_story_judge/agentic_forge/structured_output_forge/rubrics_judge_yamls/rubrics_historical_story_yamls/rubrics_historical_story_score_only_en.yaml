fields:
  - name: historical_events
    label: Historical events
    kind: enum
    choices: [1, 2, 3]
    description: >
      Integer value [1–3] measuring the plausibility of the main events
      in the story with respect to the material in <original_event>.
      Roughly: 1 = low/poor plausibility, 2 = generally plausible with some
      issues, 3 = high plausibility and overall coherence.
      Detailed criteria are described in section #Historical_scale in the prompt.

  - name: historical_characters
    label: Historical characters
    kind: enum
    choices: [1, 2, 3]
    description: >
      Integer value [1–3] evaluating the historical plausibility of characters
      (real or inspired by historical figures) and their behaviour with respect
      to <original_event>.
      Roughly: 1 = implausible or anachronistic behaviour, 2 = generally
      plausible, 3 = coherent and well aligned with the context.
      Operational criteria are given in #Historical_scale.

  - name: historical_places_settings
    label: Places and settings
    kind: enum
    choices: [1, 2, 3]
    description: >
      Integer value [1–3] evaluating the historical plausibility of places,
      settings and material details given the context described in
      <original_event>.
      Roughly: 1 = many weak or generic elements, 2 = overall plausible with
      some inaccuracies, 3 = coherent and compatible with the period and place.
      See #Historical_scale in the prompt for details.

  - name: adherence_original_event
    label: Adherence to the original event
    kind: enum
    choices: [1, 2, 3]
    description: >
      Integer value [1–3] measuring how faithful the story is to the documented
      historical event in <original_event>, while still being fiction.
      Roughly: 1 = low adherence (strong or numerous deviations),
      2 = moderate adherence (noticeable but acceptable deviations),
      3 = high adherence (the story largely stays within the described frame).
      Criteria for levels 1/2/3 are specified in #Historical_scale.
