        label: Historical events score
        kind: enum
        choices: [1, 2, 3]
        description: >
          Integer value [1–3] measuring the plausibility of the main events
          described in the story with respect to the material in <original_event>.
          In general: 1 = low/poor plausibility, 2 = plausible with some
          inaccuracies, 3 = high plausibility and overall coherence.
          Detailed criteria for choosing 1/2/3 are given in section
          #Historical_level_scale of the prompt.
      - name: analysis
        label: Historical events analysis
        kind: text
        description: >
          Short explanation (possibly using bullet points) of the reasons behind
          the assigned score, explicitly referring both to the story and to
          <original_event>. You may consider, for instance:
          - consistency of the events with the historical context (dates, places, actors);
          - presence/absence of obvious anachronisms;
          - plausibility of causes and consequences;
          - correct use of documented key events.
          Narrative guidelines are detailed in section #Historical_analysis_guidelines.

  - name: historical_characters
    label: Historical characters evaluation
    kind: object
    description: >
      Evaluation of the historical plausibility of characters (real or inspired
      by historical figures) and their behaviour, with a short explanation.
    fields:
      - name: score
        label: Historical characters score
        kind: enum
        choices: [1, 2, 3]
        description: >
          Integer value [1–3] measuring the historical plausibility of the
          characters and their behaviour with respect to <original_event>.
          In general:
          - 1 = behaviour largely implausible or anachronistic;
          - 2 = generally plausible but with some forcing;
          - 3 = coherent and well aligned with the historical and social context.
          Operational criteria for 1/2/3 are specified in #Historical_level_scale.
      - name: analysis
        label: Historical characters analysis
        kind: text
        description: >
          Short explanation (possibly with bullet points) of the reasons behind
          the score, referring to both the story and <original_event>.
          You may consider, for example:
          - whether mentality, values and prejudices fit the period;
          - plausibility of actions given social role and status;
          - realism of relationships between characters;
          - any psychological or cultural anachronisms.
          Further guidance is given in #Historical_analysis_guidelines.

  - name: historical_places_settings
    label: Places and settings evaluation
    kind: object
    description: >
      Evaluation of the historical plausibility of places, settings and material
      details with respect to the context described in <original_event>, plus explanation.
    fields:
      - name: score
        label: Places and settings score
        kind: enum
        choices: [1, 2, 3]
        description: >
          Integer value [1–3] measuring the historical plausibility of places,
          settings and material details.
          In general:
          - 1 = many elements implausible or overly generic;
          - 2 = overall plausible picture with some inaccuracies;
          - 3 = setting coherent and well compatible with period and place.
          Detailed criteria are given in #Historical_level_scale.
      - name: analysis
        label: Places and settings analysis
        kind: text
        description: >
          Short explanation (possibly using bullet points) of the reasons behind
          the score, referring to both the story and <original_event>.
          You may consider, for instance:
          - consistency with geography, urban layout and political context;
          - plausibility of buildings, objects and technologies;
          - accuracy of everyday-life details;
          - presence of material or environmental anachronisms.
          Operational instructions are described in #Historical_analysis_guidelines.

  - name: adherence_original_event
    label: Adherence to the original event
    kind: object
    description: >
      Evaluation of how faithful the story remains to the historical event
      documented in <original_event>, while still being a fictional narrative.
    fields:
      - name: score
        label: Adherence score
        kind: enum
        choices: [1, 2, 3]
        description: >
          Integer value [1–3] measuring the degree of faithfulness of the story
          to the documented historical event in <original_event>.
          In general:
          - 1 = low adherence (numerous strong deviations, reinterpretations that
            significantly alter the overall meaning);
          - 2 = moderate adherence (fictional licences are present but compatible
            with the general picture);
          - 3 = high adherence (the story mostly stays within the bounds of what
            is described, with minor or clearly recognizable fictional changes).
          Criteria for distinguishing 1/2/3 are specified in
          #Historical_level_scale in the prompt.
      - name: analysis
        label: Adherence analysis
        kind: text
        description: >
          Short explanation (possibly using bullet points) of the reasons behind
          the score, explicitly comparing key elements of <original_event> with
          those in the story. You may consider:
          - which parts of the story follow the documented event closely;
          - which parts deviate and how large the deviation is;
          - the role of fictional components in shaping historical understanding;
          - whether the changes introduced distort or preserve the core meaning
            of the event.
          Detailed guidelines are defined in #Historical_analysis_guidelines.
