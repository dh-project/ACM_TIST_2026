model_name: RubricDramaScoreOnly
fields:
  - name: storytelling_potential
    label: Storytelling potential
    kind: enum
    choices: [1, 2, 3]
    description: >
      Integer value [1–3] measuring how strongly the core narrative event
      can support an interesting, developable story.
      Roughly: 1 = poor, 2 = medium, 3 = good/high.
      For detailed criteria for levels 1–3, see section #Global_level_scale
      in the prompt.

  - name: dramatic_situation
    label: Dramatic situation
    kind: enum
    choices: [1, 2, 3]
    description: >
      Integer value [1–3] evaluating the strength and adequacy of the initial
      dramatic situation (central conflict, stakes, relationships between
      characters).
      Roughly: 1 = weak/inadequate, 2 = adequate, 3 = strong/highly adequate.
      Detailed criteria are described in section #Global_level_scale
      of the prompt.

  - name: dynamic_elements_realization
    label: Realization of dynamic elements
    kind: enum
    choices: [1, 2, 3]
    description: >
      Integer value [1–3] evaluating how the text realizes conflict
      development, event progression and character transformation.
      Roughly: 1 = weak, 2 = sufficient/acceptable, 3 = solid/strong.
      Operational definitions for levels 1–3 are specified in section
      #Global_level_scale of the prompt.

  - name: inciting
    label: Inciting incident
    kind: object
    description: >
      Status of the initial inciting incident (the trigger that starts
      the main conflict), as defined in section #Turning_points of the prompt.
      Logical rules between present, ordered and scene are also described
      in #Output_logical_rules.
    fields:
      - name: present
        label: Presence
        kind: bool
        description: >
          True if a specific inciting incident can be identified; False if
          there is no clear point where the story is "triggered".
          Logical rule: if present = False, then ordered must be False and
          scene must be "n/a". See #Turning_points and #Output_logical_rules
          for more details.

      - name: ordered
        label: Narrative order
        kind: bool
        description: >
          True if the inciting incident occurs before the climax and the
          resolution in a coherent narrative sequence; False otherwise
          (event absent, too diffuse, or located incoherently).
          Logical rule: if present = False, ordered must be False.
          Narrative criteria are described in #Turning_points.

      - name: scene
        label: Inciting scene
        kind: enum
        choices: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "n/a"]
        description: >
          String indicating the scene number ("1" to "8") where the
          inciting incident starts.
          Use "n/a" if no inciting incident can be identified (i.e. when
          present = False).
          Logical rule: if scene is "n/a", present is generally expected
          to be False. See #Turning_points for examples and clarification.

  - name: climax
    label: Climax
    kind: object
    description: >
      Status of the narrative climax, the peak moment of the main conflict.
      Definitions and criteria are given in #Turning_points.
    fields:
      - name: present
        label: Presence
        kind: bool
        description: >
          True if a recognizable peak of the main conflict exists; False if
          there is no real climax.
          Logical rule: if present = False, then ordered must be False and
          scene must be "n/a".

      - name: ordered
        label: Narrative order
        kind: bool
        description: >
          True if the climax occurs after the inciting incident and before
          the resolution; False if it is absent or incoherently placed with
          respect to the other turning points.
          Logical rule: if present = False, ordered must be False.

      - name: scene
        label: Climax scene
        kind: enum
        choices: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "n/a"]
        description: >
          String indicating the scene number ("1" to "8") where the climax
          starts.
          Use "n/a" if no true climax can be identified (present = False).
          Logical rule: scene = "n/a" generally implies present = False.
          See #Turning_points for the definition of climax.

  - name: resolution
    label: Resolution
    kind: object
    description: >
      Status of the final resolution of the main conflict. Definitions and
      criteria are given in #Turning_points.
    fields:
      - name: present
        label: Presence
        kind: bool
        description: >
          True if the story reaches a recognizable final state in relation
          to the main conflict; False if there is no real conclusion.
          Logical rule: if present = False, then ordered must be False
          and scene must be "n/a".

      - name: ordered
        label: Narrative order
        kind: bool
        description: >
          True if the resolution occurs after the climax and actually closes
          the main narrative arc; False if it is absent or incoherently placed.
          Logical rule: if present = False, ordered must be False.

      - name: scene
        label: Resolution scene
        kind: enum
        choices: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "n/a"]
        description: >
          String indicating the scene number ("1" to "8") where the resolution
          starts.
          Use "n/a" if there is no true resolution (present = False).
          Logical consistency rules between present, ordered and scene are
          summarized in #Output_logical_rules in the prompt.
